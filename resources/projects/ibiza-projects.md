Applying a Figma design handed by [Ambar Amill](https://www.ambaramill.com/) into a fully static, responsive, engaging and performant website. The project revolves around the spanish island of Ibiza and all of its ecosystem of professionals.

The client already had a Wordpress with some content, as well as liking its admin panel. So we went for a solution where we queried the Wordpress site API at build time to use its content, while keeping the wordpress admin experience.
